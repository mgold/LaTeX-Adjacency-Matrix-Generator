Adjacency Matrix Generator for LaTeX
====================================

A fairly simple python script that generates LaTeX code for adjacency matrices of graphs.

It accepts two parameters: how many vertices the graph has and a string to fill each cell of the matrix with. These can be supplied either as command line arguments or in Python. The output is printed to standard out.

Currently the code can only generate a square matrix. Later versions may add support for differing widths and heights.
